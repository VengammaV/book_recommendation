Intelligent Book Recommendations

Design a book recommendation system that retrieves book details from given datasets, processes and cleans the data before applying NLP techniques and clustering methods and builds multiple recommendation models. The final application will allow users to search for book recommendations using a user-friendly interface deployed with Streamlit and hosted on AWS. 

Recommendation models were built using:
1. Content-Based Filtering (based on Book title and Book description)
2. Clustering-Based Recommendations 
3. Hybrid Approaches (both content and clustering based approach)
